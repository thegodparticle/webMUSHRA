        <p><strong>Familiarity Rating for Songs</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Hello!</strong> We have a fun activity for you where you can let us know how well you know different songs.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's what you need to do:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You'll see a list of songs. We want to know how familiar you are with each song. Familiar means how well you know or recognize the song.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look at the scale below each song. The scale has levels that show how well you know the song. Choose the level that best describes your familiarity with the song:</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Very Familiar</li>
            <li>Quite Familiar</li>
            <li>Somewhat Familiar</li>
            <li>Not Very Familiar</li>
            <li>Not Familiar at All</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> It's okay to not know some songs, and it's great if you know others really well! Just have fun and be honest with your choices.</p>
        <p>Enjoy rating the songs and telling us how well you know them! Your opinion is important, so thank you for sharing it with us! ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶</p>
