            <h2><strong>Test Instructions</strong></h2>
        
        <h3><strong>Purpose of the Test:</strong></h3>
        <p>The purpose of this test is to help us understand your preferences for different remixed versions of a song. Your grades will help us figure out which versions you find the <strong>most enjoyable</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>How the Test Works:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In each trial, you will listen to <strong>6 different remixed versions</strong> of a song.</li>
          <li>Your job is to listen to each version and decide which one you find the <strong>most enjoyable</strong>. This version will be your <strong>reference</strong>, and you'll assign it a grade of <strong>100</strong>.</li>
          <li>After you've selected the most enjoyable version, you will compare the other versions to this reference. Assign scores from <strong>0 to 100</strong> based on how much you like each version compared to your reference.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>Listening and Grading:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are free to listen to the versions <strong>in any order you like</strong>.</li>
          <li>You can listen to each version as <strong>many times</strong> as you want before assigning a grade.</li>
          <li>Click on the play button to start listening to a version. If you wish to pause the version at any time, simply click the pause button again.</strong>.</li>
          <li>Each version will continue in a loop mode. You can switch to another version at any time and the new version will start at where the previous version stops. You can switch back and forth between two versions to facilitate comparison.</li>
          <li>To grade a specific version of the song, ensure that the version is either playing or paused.</li>  
          <li>Remember, you're the expert here! Your grades will help us understand your <strong>musical preferences</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>Grading Scale:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>100</strong>: The version you find most enjoyable. You'll assign this score to your reference version.</li>
          <li><strong>0-100</strong>: For other versions, assign a score based on how much you like them compared to your reference. We encourage you to use the whole range of grading scale.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3><strong>Watch the Video:</strong></h3>
        <br>

        <p>Before we begin, <strong>please ensure your computer's volume is turned up all the way to 100%</strong>. This is crucial for the calibration process.</p>
        <p>In this part of the test, we want to make sure that the volume of the sounds is just right for you. You'll be listening to a short sound clip, and we'd like you to adjust the volume to the most comfortable level for your ears using our on-screen slider.</p>
        <p>When you're ready, click the "Play" button to listen to the sound. Then, use the slider to increase or decrease the volume until it's comfortable for you. Don't worry, there's no right or wrong answer!</p>
        <p><strong>Volume Consistency:</strong> Once you've calibrated the volume to a comfortable level, please ensure to maintain that same volume throughout the entirety of the test. This ensures that your experience is consistent and the test results are accurate. Refrain from making any further adjustments to the volume after this calibration.</p>
        <p>Once you've set and confirmed the volume, you can move on to the next part of the test. Have fun!</p>

        <p> We have a fun activity for you to tell us how well you know different songs.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's what you need to do:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You'll listen to a list of songs. We want to know how familiar you are with each song.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look at the scale next to each song. The scale has levels that show how well you know the song. Choose the level that best describes your familiarity with the song:</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Not Familiar at All - I've never heard of it</li>
            <li>Slightly Familiar - I've heard it a few times</li>
            <li>Moderately Familiar - I recognize it and can hum along</li>
            <li>Very Familiar - I know the lyrics and could sing along</li>
            <li>Extremely Familiar - I've listened to it countless times; it could be on my playlist</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> It's okay to not know some songs, and it's great if you know others really well! Just have fun and be honest with your choices.</p>
        <p>Thank you! 🎵🎶</p>

            <li>Very Unpleasant - You find the voice highly annoying and bothersome.</li>
            <li>Unpleasant - You find the voice not enjoyable to listen to.</li>
